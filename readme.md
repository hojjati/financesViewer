This project displays the transactions of an imaginary bank account.
The data is queried from an API provided by Bench and rendered in an html table.

There are no requirements needed to run the project. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html`.

## Notes on Technologies Used
To create a Single Page Application, `AngularJS` is used as the front-end framework which
makes the architecture simple and avoids the initial set-up overhead.

`Bootstrap` and `Materialize` are used for making beautiful UI.
